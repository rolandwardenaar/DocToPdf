# Contributing to DocToPdf

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DocToPdf as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork** the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
3. **Ensure the test suite passes** by running `dotnet test`
4. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or added features
5. **Make sure your code follows** the existing style conventions
6. **Issue that pull request**!

### Code Style

- Follow standard C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O operations

Example:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Converts a Markdown document to HTML with Mermaid diagram support
/// </summary>
/// <param name="markdownContent">The Markdown content to convert</param>
/// <returns>HTML content with rendered Mermaid diagrams</returns>
public static async Task<string> ConvertMarkdownToHtml(string markdownContent)
{
    // Implementation...
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add support for SVG image formats

- Implement SVG to PNG conversion using ImageSharp
- Update ImageConverter to handle SVG files
- Add tests for SVG conversion functionality

Fixes #123
```

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DocToPdf/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
